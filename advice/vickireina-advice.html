			<h4>Be a sponge!</h4>
			<p>Absorb everything that you can. I found that when I started the process, I just wanted to keep learning and learning everything that I could get my hands on. The cool thing about learning to code, is that the more you learn, the more you want to learn. The web offers all sorts of resources to help you hone in on what you are most interested in.</p>

			<p>Practive, practice, practice. Join groups online that help you learn more about what you study in class. The more you do, the more it will become second nature to you. Just like a spoken language, the more you speak it, the easier it becomes. Before you know you, you won't have to look up, let alone think about, how to do something.</p>

			<h4>My advice to you is find out why you're learning!</h4>
			<p>Do you want to create an app?  A website?  To become a programmer like you've seen on a movie (drinking Rockstars and eating junk food)?  What do you want to do?  And, if you don't know the answer to that, start with html!</p>
